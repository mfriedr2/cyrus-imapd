Description:

Removes support for parsing and generating bytecode for the deprecated
denotify action and notify actions using the legacy (pre-RFC5435) syntax.
Existing bytecode containing these actions will still be executed.


Config changes:

None


Upgrade instructions:

Scripts that contain the deprecated denotify action should be rewritten
to remove them.
Scripts that contain notify actions using the legacy syntax should be rewritten
to use the syntax in RFC5435.
